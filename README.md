# UNT Police Incidents
We want students to know what's going on with the police on their campuses and we are bringing together three different technologies to make this happen. (Alexa, Twitter, and Web)

We use the daily logs published by the UNT police to create a dashboard that is all dynamic and students can interact with to understand what's happening around them. If you have an Alexa, you can use that to get information too. We have also designed a bot that will tweet out the incidents from the previous day on a daily basis.

### Dynamic Dashboard

It shows information of all the incidents on campus. We can also see the different types of crimes reported and their location on campus. We also have a graph of the number of incidents per day and a pie chart of the time of the day when the crime happens.

### Twitter Bot

A Twitter bot that posts information about the crimes on the UNT campus from the past 60 days every day.
